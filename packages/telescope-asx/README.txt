Ok, here's our "works on machine" prototype

Put the package folder in your Telescope's package folder

In your Telescope folder, navigate to .meteor and find a file called packages

Add "telescope-asx" (without the quotes) on its own line anywhere in the package - I hear that's how you add a new package to your Telescope.

Navigate to fetcher.js and do a search for the word "TODO". There are instructions there that you should take action upon. 

Launch your app and tell me what you think.

I'm happy to clarify where you need me to. The prototype obviously lacks nicer bells and whistles like a setup and settings page etc.
